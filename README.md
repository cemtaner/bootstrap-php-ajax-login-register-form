Hello my dear friend,
If you want to make a membership and login page, you can download and use. I have given the necessary explanations in the codes. The installation is very simple, you can use it safely if you make the necessary adjustments. I hope it will be very useful.

How to Install?

Step 1: Create a new mysql database and name the project you want
Step 2: Import the users.sql table into the database you created
Step 3: Connect to the database you created in connect.php
Step 4: Give the url path of the project to the SITE_URL variable in js/ajax.js. Example https://yoursite.com/

...and it works fine now. Otherwise you should ask me.

Thanks..
